		<h2>About Me </h2> 
		<p> My name is Emiley James. I am eighteen years and from Columbia, South Carolina. I am currently taking this CSCE 102 class because it's required for my major which is Cardiovascular Technology. I graduated from Westwood High School in Blythewood, South Carolina in the summer of 2022. I am currently a freshman and I am so excited to be at USC.	I intitnally chosen my major because I was interested in gaining clinical experience in order to become a doctor. However, I find that the career I am going into is rewarding in itself. <span id= "dots">..... </span><span id= "more">My family consists of my mom, my dad, and my younger brother. While I am from South Carolina, my family is not. My father is from Chicago, Illionis while my mother is from Washington D.C. And my brother was born in Maryland. They moved to South Carolina, due to my father's orders to go to Fort Jackson. They decided to make a permanent stay to South Carolina and we have been since 2009. We still love to visit both sides of the family every summer. </span> </p>

		<h2> My Future Career Plans </h2> 
		<p> My future career plans consisted of me graduating in December of 2026 with a bachelors of science in Cardiovascular Technology. I am currently not sure what specific specialty I will chose: invasive, noninvasive, or vascular. . I would also like to either add a public health or medical anthropology minor. With my degree I am nationally accredited in my field and would like to work for around 1-3 years, before going back to school to get a master's in public health. <span id= "dots"> .... </span><span id= "more">When looking at the specific fields there are vascular, which is using high-energy sound waves in order to evaulate blood flow and detect blood clots and other problems in the artiers and veins. Cardiac echocardiography, whichs uses high-energy sound waves in order to visualize the structure and function of the heart, And invasive, in which catheters are inserted into patient's arteries to diagnose and treat blockages that underlie certain heart problems. </span> </p>
